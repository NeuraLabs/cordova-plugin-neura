## iOS - plugin integration into sample application

### iOS implementation is currently under development and in beta
Due to a fact the cordova-neura-plugin is based on NeuraSDK.framework, and the framework is distributed separately from the plugin, please perform following steps to set up the environment correctly.

1. Download <a href="https://github.com/NeuraLabs/cordova-neura-plugin.git">Neura Cordova Plugin</a>
2. Download <a href="https://cdn.theneura.com/files/product/ios/sdk/NeuraStandaloneSDKPackage.zip">Neura SDK framework</a> and unzip the contents.
3. Copy 'NeuraSDK.framework' from the 'Release-universal' folder to previously downloaded 'path/to/cordova-neura-plugin/' folder.
4. Download <a href="https://github.com/NeuraLabs/NeuraSampleCordova.git">NeuraSampleCordova application</a>.
5. cd to application folder
6. Add iOS platform to the application: 
	'cordova platform add ios'
7. Install 'xcode' package via 'npm' for that application (necessary for correct xcode project setup):
	'npm i xcode'
8. Add previously fetched plugin (local installation):
	'cordova plugin add /path/to/cordova-neura-plugin/'
9. Build cordova project (--verbose can be omitted here): 
 	'cordova build ios --verbose'
10. Open xcode project 'path/to/NeuraSampleCordova/platforms/ios/NeuraSampleCordova.xcworkspace'
11. Select appropriate signing team.
12. If you plan on using Push Notification functionality (including NeuraSDK automatic Push Notification functionality), go to the 'Capabilities' tab of the 'NeuraSampleCordova' target and turn on 'Push Notification' capability.
